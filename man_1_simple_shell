.TH SIMPLE_SHELL 1 "December 2025" "Holberton School" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a simple UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./shell

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a basic UNIX command-line interpreter written in C. It reads commands from standard input and executes them.

The shell supports both interactive and non-interactive modes.
In interactive mode, a prompt ("$ ") is displayed and the shell waits for user input.
In non-interactive mode, commands are read from standard input without displaying a prompt.

The shell searches for commands in the directories listed in the
.B PATH
environment variable.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS

.TP
.B exit [status]
Exit the shell.

If an argument is given but is not a valid non-negative integer,
the shell writes an error message to stderr in the format:
.RS
.nf
./shell: 1: exit: Illegal number: <invalid_arg>
.fi
.RE
and exits immediately with status 2.

If a status is provided and is a valid non-negative integer,
the shell exits with that value (modulo 256, as per standard shell behavior).

If no status is provided, the shell exits with the status of the last executed command.

.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables, one per line.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The shell exits with the status of the last executed command or with the value provided to the
.B exit
built-in command.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for executable commands.

.SH EXAMPLES
Interactive mode:

.nf
$ ./shell
$ ls -l
$ env
$ exit
$ echo "ls -l" | ./shell
.fi

Non-interactive mode:

.nf
$ echo "ls /tmp" | ./shell
.fi

.SH LIMITATIONS
This shell is minimal and does not support many features of standard shells. Specifically:

Signal handling (e.g., Ctrl+C does not terminate the shell)
